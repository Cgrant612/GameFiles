The goal is to create a game that is a 3D, third-person "dungeon crawler" in the same vein as Phantasy Star Online for the GameCube or Dreamcast.

There is a "starter world" or ship, where the players gather that contains a portal to playable levels, shops for all in game items, and a bank for item and currency storage.

Players will choose a class on character creation that will dictate their stats advantage.  Each level that the players gain will increase their stats incrementally, and give them bonus stats where they can choose a stat to add to.  There are three classes to choose from and their final stats will be based on class and species.  

Once in the game, they will be able to use standard weapons that anyone can use, but will have to find weapons along the way that are specialized for their particular class.  

Split screen is a must.  The idea behind this game is to get back to the era of playing in the same room as others where everyone is on the same screen, but can explore different areas of the dungeons, if necessary.

To Do:
-Player movement and animation
  -Issues: when pulling back on the left control stick, character spasms, does not know what to do if not in forward motion
-Door animations - doors must automatically open and close when a player or npc moves in range.
-Player stats script
-Decide number of species (3?)
-NPC Scripts
-Character customization
-Character Saving/Loading
-Split-Screen capabilities
